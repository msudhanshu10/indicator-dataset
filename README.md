All dates and times in Indian Standard Time (IST). 

## Getting the indicator(s) you want

The table below is an index of how to find the indicator in our json datsets. 
**The csv files are similarly named and have the same parameters as the json files.** 

In all of the datafiles India’s hierarchy is kept same as of other states
because from the view point of data, the keys for India would be same as any
other state for all indices. The Structure of Json files is as follows- The
first layer of keys has the state name (including India) : e.g. ‘Kerala ,
‘Delhi’, etc. For each state the keys are as follows:

| Json file                    | Key name                 | Indicator obtained                                                                  |

To access the data for any of these keys use the following command: **value =
data[‘state’][‘key name’]**

Here data is object where all of the json file is loaded.

eg1. To get daily Rt point estimates for Punjab: **value =
data[‘Punjab’][‘rt_point’]**

eg2. To get daily positivity rate (moving avg) for India: **value =
data[‘India’][‘daily_positive_cases_ma’]**
